This repository contains the data, the code and the figures used in the blog post "Cities in de Volkskrant 1955-1994" published on KBLab blog [http://lab.kb.nl/]

All the datasets that are used in this example are open and can be downloaded from the flowing sources:

* The data on media coverage of Dutch cities comes from the dataset I have created during my period of researcher in residence at the Koninklijke Bibliotheek, it will be released soon. The data that we used for this analysis can be found in the folder /data of this repository
